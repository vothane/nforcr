This is a complemment project for [a murder of crows](https://github.com/vothane/A-Murder-of-Code/blob/main/aMurderOfCrows.js)
which requires me to have somewhat expert knowledge RL which can be acquired through this project. Rather this be done in Python
or javascript but these has already been done there.
